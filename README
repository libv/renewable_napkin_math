Data Source: SMARD
------------------

The files smard_consumption.csv, smard_generation.csv and smard_generation_capacity.csv
were retrieved from https://www.smard.de/en/downloadcenter/download-market-data/

It is the hourly data from 2015-01-01 (earliest available) onwards.
smard_consumption is main "Electricity consumption", and data "Actual consumption"
smard_generation is main "Electricity generation", and data "Actual generation"
smard_generation_capacity is main "Electricity generation", and data "Installed generation capacity"

SMARD uses very poor data formatting. The MW numbers have .us style thousands separators,
which is a comma, which then breaks CSV (comma seperated values). So instead of using the CSV format,
XLSX should be downloaded, and the MW numbers should be reformatted.

The XLSX has other issues, the data and timestamps are apostrophe escaped text, in american style format
(like "12:00 AM" meaning 00:00). This then requires "Data->Text to colums" conversion, before a useful
formatting style can be chosen.

Then generation capacity has some in the hourly data, which were fixed, as, except for the last 4 days
of 2021, the data does not change for whole years. These were of course fixed.

Some minor inconveniences for otherwise extremely useful data.
