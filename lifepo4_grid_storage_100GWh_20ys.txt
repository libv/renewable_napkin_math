After 20 years (7305 days), a total of 534389.28GWh was cycled through.
On average, 73.15GWh was cycled through each day, equivalent to 5343.89 full charges (73.15%).
On 2979 days, the available storage was insufficient to level out the grid load (40.78%).
The capacity of these LiFePO4 batteries will have degraded by 18.71GWh to 81.29GWh (81.29%).
Total energy loss of storing electricity in these batteries amounted to 534389.28GWh (10%).
An average increase in generation capacity of 304.81MW is needed to compensate for this loss.

Cost analysis...

Tesla Megapacks (LiFePO4, 2022): status 20221230
	Installing 1000 4h duration Megapacks (3916.00MWh) costs 1832.52M usd.
	The cost per GWh is 435.20M EUR.
	100.00GWh of grid level storage costs 43.52B EUR.
	Maintaining 1000 Megapacks costs 4.82M usd, with an increase of 2.0% per year.
	Maintaining 100.00GWh over 20 years costs 2782.15M EUR in maintenance
	Over 20 years, the cost per MWh cycled is 86.64EUR, or 8.66cents per kWh.

Server rack batteries (Trophy, 15.36kWh): status 20221230
	A single 15.36kWh server rack battery costs 4.70k usd, when bought online in the US.
	The cost per GWh is 284.27M EUR.
	100.00GWh of grid level storage costs 28.43B EUR.
	Over 20 years, the cost per MWh cycled is 53.19EUR, or 5.32cents per kWh.

Raw LiFePO4 cells (Eve LF-280k, 280Ah, from Qiso): status 20221230
	A single 896.00Wh raw LiFePO4 cell costs 93.80 EUR, for 5000 units, with shipping and customs included.
	The cost per GWh is 104.69M EUR.
	100.00GWh of grid level storage costs 10.47B EUR.
	Over 20 years, the cost per MWh cycled is 19.59EUR, or 1.96cents per kWh.

While the server rack batteries and raw cells might at first not seem relevant,
their overal cost and cost per kWh cycled are good future cost datapoints.

Tesla Megapacks are sold out 2 years into the future, and the margins are going 
to be enormous. Yet they still only cost 435.20EUR per kWh of storage, or 
8.66cents per kWh delivered for a 100.00GWh install over 20 years.

While a server rack battery has only cells, a bms, the container and some cables, 
given the enormous demand, it is a good metric for where the price for actual grid 
scale storage should be today without a Tesla markup.

Raw LiFePO4 cells are astoundingly good value, even with customs and shipping to 
germany included. And yet, the actual price, today, for manufacturing such cells is 
going to be half still. At 104.69EUR per kWh of capacity, and a cycle cost of 1.96cents 
per kWh delivered, it is where the cost of grid level storage will be, all in, 
several years in the future, when supply matches demand more closely.

Even at 86.64EUR/MWh delivered, an expensive Tesla megapack compares favourably compared 
to the nuclear power plant (EDFs EPR) being built at Hinkley Point C, which has 
a strike price of 118.85EUR/MWh (106.12GBP/MWh in 2022). This is especially striking given 
that battery storage does double duty, and a nuclear power plant is only financially viable
at a given high constant baseload over its lifetime.
